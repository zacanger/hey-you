* installation: `npm i -g hey-you`
* usage:
  * `hey-you`, or
  * `hey`, or
  * `imreallysadrightnow`, or other things (check the `bin` section of the package.json)
* take a gander. any random key should work just as well as clicking.
* alt-f4 to close it. or don't close it.
  * you should probably just leave this open all the time.
  * `hey &`

you rule.
