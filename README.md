# Hey, You

### Installation

`npm i -g hey-you`

If installation fails with an `EACCES` error on a Mac, try
`[sudo] npm install -g electron-prebuilt --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root` and
then try installing again.

### Usage

* CLI:
  * `hey-cli`, or
  * `hey-you-cli`, or
  * `heyyou-cli`

* Electron app:
  * `hey`, or
  * `hey-you`, or
  * `heyyou`

You can either click or press any keys, or both if you want.

`Alt-F4` or `Cmd-Q` to quit. Or just don't close it.

You can do `hey &` to just leave it open.

If this doesn't work for you, you may need to update Node.
(On Linux or Mac, try `npm i -g n && n latest`).

If it still doesn't work, please open an issue and I'll try to fix it ASAP!

### Changes

- `1.0.0` add CLI, remove `cheer-me-up` and `imreallysadrightnow`.

## hey, you...
## you rule.
