# Hey, You

### Installation

`npm i -g hey-you`

### Usage
* `hey`, or
* `hey-you`, or
* `heyyou`, or
* `cheer-me-up`
* `imreallysadrightnow`

You can either click or press any keys, or both if you want.

`Alt-F4` or `Cmd-Q` to quit. Or just don't close it.

You can do `hey &` to just leave it open.

If this doesn't work for you, you may need to update Node.
(On Linux or Mac, try `npm i -g n && n latest`).

If it still doesn't work, please open an issue and I'll try to fix it ASAP!

## hey, you...
## you rule.
